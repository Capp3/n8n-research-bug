# Active Context

- Platform: Linux (path separator "/"), standard UNIX tools (ls, chmod)
- Mode: IMPLEMENT â€” AI Agent workflow JSON corrected and validated
- Memory Bank files located in `docs/`:
  - `productContext.md`
  - `systemPatterns.md`
  - `techContext.md`
  - `progress.md`
  - `tasks.md`
  - `creative-architecture-decisions.md` (architectural design document - still valid)
  - `ai-agent-workflow-plan.md` (comprehensive workflow plan)
  - `implementation-summary.md` (implementation details and verification)
- Primary deliverable: `workflow/research-bug-ai-agents.json` (29 nodes, AI Agent implementation)
- Primary reference: `../projectbrief.md`
- Key conventions: UV for Python, context7 for code review
- Previous attempts: Basic OpenAI nodes and AI Agent nodes both had issues

Next step: REFLECT mode to review implementation and plan next phases (database setup, MCP servers, credential configuration, testing).
