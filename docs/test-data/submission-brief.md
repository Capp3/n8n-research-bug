# Submission Brief: UK-Ireland Drone Regulations Comparison

I have completed a report about flying drones in the UK, which covers licensing, insurance, and legal/liability requirements. I need to expand this document to also cover the Republic of Ireland.

## Research Requirements

Please:
1. Review the existing report for clarity, structure, and completeness
2. Conduct comprehensive research into equivalent regulations in the Republic of Ireland:
   - Licensing requirements for drone operators
   - Insurance obligations
   - Legal restrictions on drone use (airspace rules, privacy concerns, etc.)
   - Liability frameworks (civil and criminal implications)
3. Create a comparative analysis section highlighting major differences between UK and Irish regulations
4. Propose a unified structure that makes it easy for readers to compare requirements
5. Include practical guidance sections for media professionals
6. Add a compliance checklist for operating in both jurisdictions
7. Maintain professional tone accessible to non-legal professionals

## Desired Structure

The final document should include:
- Executive Summary
- Table of Contents
- UK Regulations (existing content enhanced)
- Republic of Ireland Regulations (new research)
- Comparative Analysis
- Practical Compliance Guide
- Appendices with key contact information and resources
