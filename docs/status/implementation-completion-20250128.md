## Configuration Highlights

### Resource Optimization
- **Conservative CPU limits**: 0.25-1.0 cores per service
- **Efficient memory allocation**: 256MB-1GB per service
- **No resource reservations**: Prevents startup conflicts
- **Proper restart policies**: `unless-stopped` for reliability

### Port Management
- **Sequential allocation**: 3002-3007 for MCP services
- **Database ports**: 5433-5435 for PostgreSQL instances
- **Web services**: 8080-8088 for management interfaces
- **No conflicts**: All services have unique port assignments

### Environment Configuration
- **API keys**: Properly configured for external services
- **Database credentials**: Secure, unique passwords per service
- **Service discovery**: Internal networking for service communication
- **Health checks**: Appropriate monitoring for each service type

## Testing Results

### ✅ Successful Tests
- **Docker Compose Configuration**: Valid syntax, no errors
- **Service Startup**: All services start without configuration errors
- **Network Communication**: Services can communicate within the network
- **Database Connectivity**: All PostgreSQL instances working properly
