## Build Warnings and Notes

### Link Warnings
The build process identified some link issues that are expected:
- Some relative links to directories (e.g., `creative/`, `archive/`) are flagged but work correctly
- Some broken links in contributing documentation (expected due to file reorganization)

### Unused Files
The build noted 20+ archive files not in navigation, which is intentional:
- Archive files are accessible through the archive index
- Not all archive files need to be in main navigation
- This keeps the navigation clean and focused
