## Archive Strategy

### Grouping Strategy
**Option 1: Individual Archives** (Recommended)
- Create separate archive for each major task
- Provides detailed tracking and specific lessons learned
- Easier to reference specific implementations
- Better for future similar tasks

**Option 2: Grouped Archives**
- Group related tasks (e.g., all Creative Mode tasks)
- Reduces archive count but may lose specific details
- Good for high-level project milestones

### Recommended Approach
**Individual Archives** for the following reasons:
1. **Specificity**: Each task has unique requirements and lessons
2. **Reference Value**: Future similar tasks can reference specific archives
3. **Completeness**: Maintains detailed record of each implementation
4. **Searchability**: Easier to find specific information

## Archive Priority

### High Priority (Should be archived first)
1. **Creative Phase - Prompt Documentation System Design** (Level 3, foundational)
2. **Foundation Setup and Prompt System Implementation** (Level 3, core system)
3. **Document Organization and Structure Reorganization** (Level 3, system-wide)

### Medium Priority
4. **N8N Workflow Analysis and Documentation** (Level 2, analysis)
5. **N8N Credentials Documentation and Configuration Guide** (Level 2, documentation)
6. **Support Services Documentation and Infrastructure Guide** (Level 2, documentation)

### Lower Priority
7. **Contributing Documentation and Guidelines** (Level 2, documentation)
8. **GitHub Pages Deployment and Documentation Hosting** (Level 2, deployment)
9. **GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflows and Automation** (Level 2, CI/CD)
10. **Makefile Enhancement and Development Tools** (Level 2, tools)
11. **Variable Mapping and Workflow Alignment** (Level 2, configuration)

## Archive Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: High Priority Archives
1. Create archive for Creative Phase tasks
2. Create archive for Foundation Setup
3. Create archive for Document Organization

### Phase 2: Medium Priority Archives
4. Create archive for N8N Workflow Analysis
5. Create archive for N8N Credentials Documentation
6. Create archive for Support Services Documentation

### Phase 3: Lower Priority Archives
7. Create remaining archives for documentation, deployment, and tools

## Archive Document Structure

Each archive should include:
- **Metadata**: Complexity, type, date, related tasks
- **Summary**: Brief overview of the task
- **Requirements**: What the task needed to accomplish
- **Implementation**: How the task was implemented
- **Testing**: How the solution was verified
- **Lessons Learned**: Key takeaways from the task
- **References**: Links to related documents

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve**: Review this analysis and approve the archive strategy
2. **Prioritize**: Decide which archives to create first
3. **Create Archives**: Begin creating archive documents following the established format
4. **Update Tasks**: Move completed tasks to archived status in tasks.md
5. **Update References**: Ensure all cross-references are maintained

## Conclusion

There are **11 major completed tasks** that need to be archived, representing significant project work across creative design, implementation, documentation, and infrastructure setup. The recommended approach is to create individual archives for each task to maintain detailed records and provide specific reference value for future similar work.
