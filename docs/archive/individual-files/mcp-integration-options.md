# MCP Integration Options for n8n Research Bug

## Overview

This document outlines Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration options for the n8n Research Bug project, with a focus on enhancing research capabilities while maintaining simplicity and Docker compatibility. The goal is to replace the Context7 MCP analyzer with more specialized research and data retrieval tools that complement n8n's native capabilities.

## ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ ENTERING CREATIVE PHASE: ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

## Component Description

The MCP integration component provides AI models with access to external data sources, research tools, and knowledge bases through standardized MCP servers. This component enhances the Research Agent's capabilities by providing access to specialized tools beyond what's available through standard n8n nodes.

## Requirements & Constraints

1. **Docker Compatibility**: All MCP servers must be deployable via Docker
2. **n8n Integration**: Must complement rather than duplicate n8n's native capabilities
3. **Research Focus**: Primary focus on document enhancement and research tools
4. **Simplicity**: Avoid over-engineering with too many specialized tools
5. **Gemini Compatibility**: Must work well with Gemini models that have internet access
6. **Cost Efficiency**: Preference for open-source or free-tier API options

## Options Analysis

### Option 1: Minimal MCP Integration

**Description**: Use only 1-2 essential MCP servers to supplement n8n's native HTTP Request nodes.

**Components**:
- **mcp-server-brave-search**: For comprehensive web search capabilities
- **n8n HTTP Request nodes**: For all other API integrations

**Pros**:
- Simplest implementation with minimal configuration
- Leverages n8n's native HTTP capabilities
- Lowest resource requirements
- Easiest to maintain

**Cons**:
- Limited specialized research capabilities
- More complex prompt engineering required
- Less structured data from generic HTTP responses

### Option 2: Research-Focused MCP Suite

**Description**: Deploy a suite of research-oriented MCP servers focused on different knowledge domains.

**Components**:
- **mcp-server-brave-search**: General web search
- **mcp-server-wikipedia**: Factual knowledge and references
- **mcp-server-arxiv**: Academic paper research
- **mcp-server-pubmed**: Medical research
- **mcp-server-scholar**: Academic citations

**Pros**:
- Comprehensive research capabilities
- Specialized tools for different knowledge domains
- Structured data responses
- Better citation and reference handling

**Cons**:
- More complex Docker configuration
- Higher resource requirements
- More API keys to manage
- Potential redundancy with n8n capabilities

### Option 3: Balanced MCP Integration with n8n Tools

**Description**: Integrate select MCP servers that complement n8n's native capabilities, focusing on areas where n8n has limitations.

**Components**:
- **mcp-server-brave-search**: For comprehensive web search
- **mcp-server-wikipedia**: For factual knowledge base access
- **n8n-mcp**: For AI-assisted n8n workflow building
- **n8n HTTP Request nodes**: For additional API integrations

**Pros**:
- Balanced approach with moderate complexity
- Leverages both MCP and n8n strengths
- Moderate resource requirements
- Good coverage of research needs
- n8n-mcp provides workflow assistance

**Cons**:
- Still requires multiple service configurations
- Some overlap between tools
- Requires understanding of both paradigms

### Option 4: Comprehensive Knowledge Base Integration

**Description**: Focus on knowledge base and document repository integrations rather than general search.

**Components**:
- **mcp-server-confluence**: For organizational knowledge
- **mcp-server-notion**: For collaborative documents
- **mcp-server-gitbook**: For technical documentation
- **mcp-server-arxiv**: For academic research
- **n8n HTTP Request nodes**: For general web search

**Pros**:
- Excellent for structured knowledge retrieval
- Better for specialized document research
- Good for technical and academic content
- Structured data responses

**Cons**:
- Limited general web search capabilities
- Higher complexity in setup
- More credentials to manage
- More specialized use case

## Recommended Approach

Based on the analysis, **Option 3: Balanced MCP Integration with n8n Tools** provides the optimal balance of capabilities, complexity, and resource efficiency for the n8n Research Bug project.

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Docker Compose Integration**:
   ```yaml
   # Add to compose.yml
   mcp-brave-search:
     image: ghcr.io/yourusername/mcp-brave-search:latest
     restart: unless-stopped
     container_name: mcp-brave-search
     environment:
       BRAVE_API_KEY: ${BRAVE_API_KEY}
     ports:
       - ${BRAVE_SEARCH_PORT:-3002}:3000
     healthcheck:
       test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
       interval: 30s
       timeout: 10s
       retries: 3

   mcp-wikipedia:
     image: ghcr.io/yourusername/mcp-wikipedia:latest
     restart: unless-stopped
     container_name: mcp-wikipedia
     ports:
       - ${WIKIPEDIA_PORT:-3003}:3000
     healthcheck:
       test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
       interval: 30s
       timeout: 10s
       retries: 3
   
   # Uncomment the existing n8n-mcp service
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```env
   # Add to .env
   BRAVE_API_KEY=your-brave-api-key
   BRAVE_SEARCH_PORT=3002
   WIKIPEDIA_PORT=3003
   ```

3. **Research Agent Prompt Update**:
   ```
   You are a Research Agent with access to the following tools:
   
   1. Brave Search MCP: For comprehensive web search
   2. Wikipedia MCP: For factual knowledge and references
   3. n8n HTTP Request: For additional API access
   
   Use these tools to research the topic thoroughly and provide:
   - Factual information with proper citations
   - Comparative analysis when relevant
   - Current data and statistics
   - Academic perspectives when available
   
   Your response should be well-structured markdown with:
   - Clear section headings
   - Proper citation links
   - A references section at the end
   ```

4. **n8n Workflow Integration**:
   - Update the Research Agent node to use the new MCP tools
   - Configure HTTP Request nodes for any additional API needs
   - Update variable mapping for the new data sources
   - Add appropriate error handling for MCP server failures
