# Creative Process Digest

## Design Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **[Document Refactoring Architecture](./document-refactoring-architecture-design.md)**
  - Comprehensive restructure with clear separation of concerns
  - Organized reflection, consolidated archives, and digest views
  - Information preservation through consolidation rather than deletion
  - Scalable structure supporting future content growth

### UI/UX Decisions
- **[Document Refactoring UI/UX](./document-refactoring-uiux-design.md)**
  - Digest-first navigation reducing complexity while maintaining access
  - Progressive disclosure with overview → detail access pattern
  - Mobile-optimized design with clear content hierarchy
  - Simplified navigation structure for better user experience

### Algorithm Decisions
- **[Prompt System Algorithm](./algorithm.md)**
  - HTTP GET with retry+TTL cache implementation
  - Assembly envelope with jsdiff unified diff and truncation
  - Hybrid system prompt approach (shared core + agent-specific addenda)
  - Agent user prompt templates with frontmatter schema

## Process Documentation

### Creative Phase Process
- **Architecture Design**: Component structure, data flow patterns, interface design
- **UI/UX Design**: User flow analysis, component hierarchy, interaction patterns
- **Algorithm Design**: Complexity analysis, efficiency optimization, edge case handling

### Design Rationale
- **Comprehensive Approach**: Addresses all identified problems without information loss
- **User Experience Focus**: Clear hierarchy with overview → detail access pattern
- **Information Preservation**: All information preserved through consolidation
- **Scalability**: Structure supports future content growth and evolution

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Directory Structure**: Clear separation between active and archived content
- **Navigation Strategy**: Digest views reduce complexity while maintaining access
- **Content Organization**: Date-based organization for reflections and archives
- **Consolidation Strategy**: Merge similar documents while preserving unique information
