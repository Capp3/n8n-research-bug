- **Volumes**: 5 persistent volumes
- **Ports**: 11 exposed ports (3001-3007, 5433-5435, 6379, 8080, 8088)

### Environment Configuration
- **File**: `.env`
- **Variables**: 25+ environment variables
- **API Keys**: Brave Search, Firecrawl
- **Database Credentials**: 3 PostgreSQL instances
- **Service Ports**: Sequential allocation (3002-3007)

### Resource Allocation

- **Memory Limits**: 256MB-1GB per service
- **Strategy**: Conservative allocation without reservations
- **Restart Policy**: `unless-stopped` for all services

## Key Achievements

### 1. **Architectural Excellence**
- **Focused Service Selection**: Eliminated unnecessary services based on user feedback
- **Dual Service Patterns**: Successfully implemented both HTTP and stdio MCP service patterns
- **Resource Management**: Conservative allocation prevented startup conflicts
- **Service Dependencies**: Proper dependency management ensured reliable startup

### 2. **Technical Innovation**
- **Service Discovery**: Identified and implemented two distinct MCP service patterns
- **Port Management**: Sequential allocation prevented conflicts
- **Health Check Strategy**: Appropriate health checks for different service types
- **Configuration Management**: Comprehensive environment variable setup

### 3. **User Collaboration**
- **Feedback Integration**: Quickly adapted to user preferences
- **Problem Resolution**: User successfully resolved NocoDB configuration
- **Scope Refinement**: Real-time adjustments based on user needs
- **Feature Prioritization**: Focused on essential capabilities

### 4. **Future-Proofing**
- **Commented Services**: Ready-to-enable configurations for future services
- **Expansion Framework**: Clear path for adding new MCP services
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for future development
- **Configuration Templates**: Reusable patterns for new services

## Challenges Overcome

### 1. **MCP Service Architecture Discovery**
**Challenge**: Initial assumption that all MCP services would run as HTTP services
**Impact**: Several services (Wikipedia, Firecrawl, Puppeteer, Time, Sequential Thinking) are designed for stdio mode
**Resolution**: Adapted implementation to support both patterns
**Lesson**: Research service architecture patterns before implementation

### 2. **NocoDB Database Configuration**
**Challenge**: Complex database connection string format requirements
**Impact**: Multiple attempts to configure PostgreSQL connection
**Resolution**: User intervention with correct configuration
**Lesson**: Some services require deeper configuration research or expert knowledge

### 3. **Resource Allocation Strategy**
**Challenge**: Balancing performance with resource constraints
**Impact**: Initial aggressive reservations caused startup issues
**Resolution**: Conservative allocation without reservations
**Lesson**: Start conservative and scale up based on actual usage

### 4. **Service Health Monitoring**
**Challenge**: stdio services don't support HTTP health checks
**Impact**: Inability to monitor stdio services via standard health check mechanisms
**Resolution**: Removed health checks for stdio services, focused on HTTP services
**Lesson**: Different service types require different monitoring strategies

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Service Architecture Patterns**
**Key Learning**: MCP services come in two distinct patterns:
- **HTTP Services**: Run as web services with REST APIs (Brave Search MCP)
- **stdio Services**: Designed for direct integration with MCP clients (Wikipedia, Firecrawl, etc.)

**Application**: Future MCP integrations should be categorized by pattern before implementation.

### 2. **Resource Management**
**Key Learning**: Conservative resource allocation prevents startup conflicts while maintaining adequate performance.

**Application**: Always start with minimal resources and scale based on actual usage patterns.

### 3. **User Collaboration**
**Key Learning**: Active user feedback during implementation is more valuable than extensive upfront planning.

**Application**: Implement in iterative cycles with frequent user feedback integration.

### 4. **Configuration Complexity**
**Key Learning**: Some services (like NocoDB) have complex configuration requirements that may require expert knowledge.

**Application**: Identify potential configuration challenges early and plan for expert consultation if needed.

## Process Improvements

### 1. **Implementation Approach**
**Current Process**: PLAN → CREATIVE → IMPLEMENT
**Improvement**: Add "RESEARCH" phase before CREATIVE to understand service architectures
**Benefit**: Reduces implementation surprises and rework

### 2. **Service Testing Strategy**
**Current Process**: Test services individually after implementation
**Improvement**: Create service testing matrix during planning phase
**Benefit**: More systematic validation of service functionality

### 3. **Configuration Management**
**Current Process**: Trial-and-error configuration approach
**Improvement**: Research configuration requirements during planning phase
**Benefit**: Faster implementation with fewer configuration iterations

### 4. **Documentation Updates**
**Current Process**: Update documentation after implementation
**Improvement**: Update documentation during implementation phases
**Benefit**: More accurate and timely documentation
