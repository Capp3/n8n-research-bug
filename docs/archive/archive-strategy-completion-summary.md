## Tasks List Updates

### Current Tasks (Streamlined)
- [ ] Execute end-to-end testing per testing plan
- [ ] Test deployment process and verify site accessibility (pending GitHub Pages setup)
- [ ] Maintain `docs/status/tasks.md` as the single source of truth
- [ ] Align Memory Bank docs with `docs/projectbrief.md`

### Completed Tasks (Updated)
- Moved all completed tasks to the completed section
- Added archive references for archived tasks
- Marked tasks as "COMPLETED" or "COMPLETED (pending archive)"
- Maintained detailed implementation notes for reference

## Archive Index Updates

### Archive Structure
- **4 Total Archives**: 3 new + 1 existing (Final Documentation Refactor)
- **Archive Index**: Updated with all archive summaries and references
- **Cross-References**: All archives properly linked and documented

### Archive Guidelines
- **Naming Convention**: `[task-name]-YYYYMMDD.md`
- **Content Structure**: Metadata, summary, requirements, implementation, testing, lessons learned, references
- **Maintenance**: Permanent records with no modifications after creation

## Remaining Archive Work

### Medium Priority (Ready for Archive)

2. **Continue Archiving**: Create archives for remaining completed tasks
3. **Update References**: Ensure all cross-references are maintained

### Future
1. **Archive Maintenance**: Maintain archive index and guidelines
2. **Process Improvement**: Refine archive process based on experience
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Use archives for future similar tasks

## Conclusion

The archive strategy has been successfully implemented with the creation of three comprehensive archives for the highest-priority completed tasks. The tasks list has been streamlined and updated to reflect current status, and the archive structure provides a solid foundation for ongoing project documentation and knowledge management.

**Status**: Archive strategy implementation complete for high-priority tasks
**Next Phase**: Continue with medium and lower priority task archiving
**Benefit**: Comprehensive project documentation and knowledge management system established
