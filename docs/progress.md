# Progress

- 2025-09-14: Initialized Memory Bank (VAN Level 1). Platform detection complete: Linux, "/" path separator; UNIX command set.
- 2025-09-14: Moved documentation files into `docs/` directory.
- 2025-09-14: Recorded key preferences: Always use UV for Python operations, always use context7 for code review.
- 2025-09-14: Completed PLAN mode - Comprehensive node-by-node workflow specification with 19 nodes, verified against n8n documentation.
- 2025-09-14: Completed CREATIVE mode - Architecture decisions finalized: dual memory system, intelligent MCP routing, session lifecycle, hybrid prompts, GitHub evolution tracking.
- 2025-09-14: Completed IMPLEMENT mode - Created complete n8n workflow JSON (`workflow/research-bug.json`) with 25 nodes implementing all architectural decisions and verified n8n node types.
- 2025-09-14: Fixed import error - Made all credential names and IDs unique to resolve "propertyValues[itemName] is not iterable" error. All 19 credential references now have unique names and IDs.
- 2025-09-14: Updated node structures for n8n v1.110.1 compatibility - Fixed Form Trigger formFields structure and converted all OpenAI nodes from legacy "agent: conversationalAgent" format to modern "resource: chat, operation: create" format with proper messages array structure.
- 2025-09-14: Created AI Agent workflow (`workflow/research-bug-ai-agents.json`) - Rebuilt workflow using AI Agent nodes with proper tool connections for MCP integration. Agents can now autonomously choose and use tools (Firecrawl, Searxng, Chat Memory) for enhanced research capabilities.
- 2025-09-14: Fresh start - Deleted all workflow files and plans to begin with clean slate for proper AI Agent implementation.
- 2025-09-14: PLAN mode completed - Created comprehensive AI Agent workflow plan (`docs/ai-agent-workflow-plan.md`) with 29 nodes using proper `n8n-nodes-langchain.agent` nodes with tool connections for MCP integration, RAG architecture with pgvector, and comprehensive error handling. All nodes verified against n8n v1.110.1 documentation.
- 2025-09-14: IMPLEMENT mode completed - Built complete AI Agent workflow JSON (`workflow/research-bug-ai-agents.json`) with 29 nodes using `n8n-nodes-langchain.agent` nodes with proper tool connections. Features: 5 AI Agents with tool connections, RAG with pgvector, MCP integration via tools, comprehensive error handling, and session management.
- 2025-09-14: IMPLEMENT mode corrected - Fixed AI Agent node structure based on working example. Updated to use `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent` with proper connection types (`ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_tool`). JSON validates successfully and ready for import.
