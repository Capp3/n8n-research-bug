# Example Form Submission

## Initial Request

I would like to expand this Monarch butterfly report to include more detailed information about home garden conservation. Specifically, I want to add a new section about creating Monarch-friendly gardens with specific plant recommendations, and I'd like to explore the relationship between Monarch butterflies and beneficial insects like ladybugs and bees. Please also include current population data from 2023-2024 and highlight any recent conservation success stories. The report should be more actionable for readers who want to help with conservation efforts in their own communities.

## Writing Tone

### Voice and Persona

- **Professional warmth**: confident but measured; respectful and courteous

### Formatting (Markdown)

- Use ATX headers and bullet points; avoid numbered lists unless sequence matters
- Use horizontal rules (`---`) to separate major sections
- Numbers: spell out one–nine unless technical; use numerals for 10+ or measurements

- Dates: use "Month YYYY"; ranges use "Month YYYY – Month YYYY" or "Month YYYY – Present"

### Do and Don't

- Do: write clearly, keep a respectful and confident tone
