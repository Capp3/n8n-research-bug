A sophisticated multi-agent AI workflow for document enhancement, research, and ongoing collaboration using n8n, LangChain, and Telegram integration.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive document processing pipeline that combines multiple AI agents to enhance, research, review, and iteratively improve documents. The workflow supports both initial document submission and ongoing collaborative editing through Telegram.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Editor, Research, Reviewer, and Editor Merge agents with specialized roles
- **Two-Part Prompt System**: Hybrid system prompts (shared core + agent-specific addenda) with user prompt templates
- **Semantic Retrieval**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for context-aware research
- **GitHub Integration**: Automated file creation and updates with version control
- **Telegram Collaboration**: Ongoing document editing through chat interface
- **Research Enhancement**: Specialized MCP servers for research and data retrieval
- **Memory Persistence**: Conversation state management across sessions

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- OpenAI or Anthropic API access
- GitHub repository with API access
- PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension (or use `make docker-up`)
- Telegram bot (for ongoing collaboration)
- MCP servers for research and data retrieval (configured via Docker)

### Environment Setup

1. **Copy the sample environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp sample.env .env
   ```

2. **Start the services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Start the prompt server:**
   ```bash
   cd prompt-server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

See [ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for detailed configuration instructions.

### Development Commands

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile with commands for all development tasks:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make help` | Show all available commands with descriptions |
| `make setup` | Install dependencies and set up development environment |
| `make dev` | Complete development setup (setup + docker + serve-docs) |
| `make docker-up` | Start PostgreSQL, Redis, and Adminer containers |
| `make docker-health` | Check health status of all services |
| `make serve-docs` | Start MkDocs development server |
| `make test` | Run all tests (prompt-server + documentation) |
| `make status` | Show current project status and task progress |
| `make validate` | Validate project structure and configuration |

> **ðŸ“‹ Complete Command Reference**: See [Makefile Commands](docs/implementation/makefile-commands.md) for detailed documentation of all available commands.

### Installation

1. **Quick Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Complete development environment setup
   make setup && make dev
   ```

2. **Import Workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance
   # See docs/implementation/setup-guide.md for detailed instructions
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Set up required credentials and environment variables
   # See docs/implementation/configuration.md for details
   ```

4. **Start Support Services**:
   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL, Redis, and Adminer
   make docker-up
   ```

5. **Development Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Start prompt server in development mode
   make prompt-server
   
   # Build and serve documentation
   make serve-docs
   
   # Run all tests
   make test
   
   # View all available commands
   make help
   ```

### Basic Usage

1. **Initial Document Submission**:
   - Access the n8n form trigger
   - Submit your markdown document with research requirements
   - The workflow will enhance, research, and review your document
   - Final output is saved to your GitHub repository

2. **Ongoing Collaboration**:
   - Send messages to your Telegram bot
   - The workflow retrieves the current document
   - AI agents process your requests and update the document
   - Changes are committed to GitHub with detailed commit messages
